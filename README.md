## Sample

I find useful to add an alias in my ~/.bash_aliases

```bash
alias msad='/usr/local/bin/msad --host=dmc1it.group.redaelli.org --port=636 --search_base dc=group,dc=redaelli,dc=org'
```

Retreive info about a user

```bash
msad check_user matteo 90 \[qliksense_analyzer,qliksense_professional\] 2>/dev/null
```

```json
{"is_disabled": false}
{"is_locked": false}
{"has_never_expires_password": false}
{"has_expired_password": false}
{"membership_qliksense_analyzer": false}
{"membership_qliksense_professional": true}
```

Getting nested group members (it is a pages search, it can retreive more than 1000 users)

```bash
msad --out_format csv --attributes samaccountname,mail,sn,givenName group_flat_members "dc=group,dc=redaelli,dc=org" --group_name "qliksense_admin"
```
